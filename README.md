## Purpose
This repository is my ongoing **Data Science Portfolio**, where I document projects that demonstrate my skills in:

- visualization

## Planned Structure
I will organize projects into folders as I progress:
- `EDA/` — exploratory data analysis projects  
- `Visualization/` — dashboards, charts, storytelling projects
