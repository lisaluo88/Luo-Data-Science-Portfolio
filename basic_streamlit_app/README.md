# Luo-Data-Science-Portfolio

## Purpose
This repository serves as my semester-long Data Science portfolio. It contains coding projects, analyses, and applications that demonstrate my progress and skills in data science.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Working with real-world datasets
- Building interactive applications with Streamlit

## Repository Structure
- `basic_streamlit_app/` – A basic Streamlit app that loads data from a CSV file and allows interactive filtering
- `week-02/` – Weekly coursework and practice exercises
- `week-04/` – Additional projects and assignments completed during the semester

## Streamlit App
The Streamlit app demonstrates:
- Loading data from a CSV file
- Displaying datasets interactively
- Using dropdowns and filters to explore data

To run the app locally:
```bash
streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py
